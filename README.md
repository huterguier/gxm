[``gxm``](https://github.com/huterguier/gxm) aims to be the [``gym``](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/)-equivalent for [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax)-based RL Environments.
It normalizes different environment backends behind one tiny, purely functional API that is `jit`, `vmap` and `scan` friendly and explicit about randomness.
For a more detailed description please refer to the [documentation](https://gxm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Features
- ü§ù**Unified Functional Interface:** ``gxm`` unifies different environment libraries behind one tiny API. This eases development and experimentation with different environments.
- üåê**Broad Environment Support:** ``gxm`` supports a wide range of environments from different libraries. A complete list of supported environments can be found below.
- üíª**CPU based Enironments:** Run your favorite CPU based environments directly in JAX via callbacks. These wrappers also support `vmap` and behave ([almost](https://gxm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the_sharp_bits.html#cpu-based-environments)) exactly like the other JAX-native environments!
- ‚úÖ**Handling Truncation:** ``gxm`` handles truncation and termination in a unified way across all environments. Note that handling trunctation in JAX adds a slight memory overhead but can be disabled if not needed.


## API

Environments in ``gxm`` can be created in the standardized way by using a `make` function.
The identifier strings are of the form `<Library>/<Environment-Name>`.
```python
import gxm
env = gxm.make("Gymnasium/LunarLander-v3")
```
The returned environment object exposes the methods `init`, `step` and `reset`.
Note that there is a clear distinction between `reset` and `init`. 
`init` is used to create a new environment state from scratch while `reset` is used to reset an existing environment state.
For fully functional environments there is no difference between the two, but for CPU based environments `reset` will reuse the existing environment instance while `init` will create a new one.
In addition this conforms to the common JAX pattern of having an `init` function to create an initial state.


```python
env_state, timestep = env.init(key)
for _ in range(1e3):
    env_state, timestep = env.step(key, env_state, action)
env_state, timestep = env.reset(key, env_state)
```
As a reminder, you should never use `for` loops for environment rollouts in JAX. This is just for demonstration purposes.üòâ


## Supported Environments
Currently ``gxm`` supports the following Libraries.
- [Gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) (Classic Control, bsuite and MinAtar)
- [Pgx](https://github.com/sotetsuk/pgx) (Boardgames and MinAtar)
- [Navix](https://github.com/epignatelli/navix) (Minigrid in JAX)
- [Envpool](https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool) (Vectorized Gymnasium Environements)
- [Craftax](https://github.com/MichaelTMatthews/Craftax) (Crafter in JAX)
- [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) (Classic Control, Atari, Box2D, MuJoCo, etc.)

The following environments are planned to be supported in the future.
- [Brax](https://github.com/google/brax) (Physics-based Environments in JAX)
- [DeepMind Control Suite](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_control) (Physics-based Environments in Python)
- [Jumanji](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji) (Various RL Environments in JAX)


## Installation
``gxm`` can be installed directly from PyPI.
```
pip install gxm
```
By default Gxm comes without any of the underlying environment libraries.
You can install any combination of them by using optional dependencies or all of the at once using ``all``.
```
pip install gxm[gymnax, pgx, navix, envpool, craftax, gymnasium]
```
