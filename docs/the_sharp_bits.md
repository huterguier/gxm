## CPU-based Environments
CPU-based environemnts like `envpool` and `gymnasium` are not actually functional under the hood.
Hence, they can be used for sequential rollouts only.
Trying to call the step function from the same state twice will result in an error or unexpected behavior.

```python
import gxm, jax

env = gxm.make("Envpool/CartPole-v1")
key = jax.random.key(0)
env_state = env.init(key)
next_env_state = env.step(env_state, key, 0)
# This will cause an error or unexpected behavior
next_env_state = env.step(env_state, key, 0)
```

Usually this is not an issue, as environments are typically used in a sequential manner.
However specialized algorithms, such as [MCTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search), are not compatible with these environments.

## ``init`` vs ``reset``
Typically, RL environments have a `reset` function that resets the environment to an initial state.
In ``gxm``, there is a clear distinction between `init` and `reset`. 
- `init`: This function initializes the environment and returns the initial state.
- `reset`: This function resets the environment to a new initial state after an episode ends. It can be called multiple times during the lifecycle of an environment.

This distinction is motivated by two key aspects:
1. **Consistency**: Most JAX libraries use the ``init`` function to initialize states. 
   By using `init` for the initial state, we maintain consistency with other JAX libraries.
2. **Compatibility**: CPU-based environments like `envpool` and gymnasium maintain a reference to the environment instance on the host.
   Calling ``reset`` without this state would lead to an instantiation of a new environment, which is not the intended behavior.

## Using ``envpool``
Envpool is no longer maintained. The non-optional XLA-interface relies on JAX<0.4.27
and importing envpool unavoidably leads to a an error due to breaking changes in JAX.
In order to use ``envpool``, you need to replace the entire content of ``envpool/python/xla_template.py`` with the following two lines.
```python
def make_xla(obj):
    pass
```

## Termination and Truncation
Handling termination and truncation correctly is essential for the correctness of many reinforcement learning algorithms.
Yet most JAX-based environment libraries do not account for this at all.
Handling truncation is not problematic when handling resets manually, but becomes tricky when using auto-resets, as the true observation is lost when the environment is reset.
While on CPU-based environments the true observation can be returned conditionally, in JAX this is not possible as the returned structure must be known at compile time.
This means that the only way to handle truncation correctly is to always return the true observation, even if there was no truncation at that step.

In the example below, the `IgnoreTruncation` wrapper will treat truncation as termination, setting the `terminated` flag to `True` when truncation occurs. In addition it will set `true_obs` to `None` for all timesteps to save memory.

```python
import gxm
from gxm.wrappers import IgnoreTruncation, Rollout
env = IgnoreTruncation(gxm.make("Envpool/Breakout-v5"))
```

## Composite Spaces
In most environment libraries, different classes are used to represent composite spaces such as dictionaries, tuples, and other structured combinations. 
`gxm` unifies composite spaces by relying on PyTrees, eliminating the need for separate classes. 
This allows for arbitrary compositions, such as tuples of dictionaries of tuples, and simplifies extension to new types of spaces, as long as they follow the pytree structure.
```python
from gxm.spaces import Discrete, Tree
space = Tree({
    "position": Discrete(5),
    "velocity": Discrete(3),
    "info": {
        "goal": Discrete(2),
        "obstacles": (Discrete(4), Discrete(4))
    }
})
```
